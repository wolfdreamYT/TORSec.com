TORSec

the most encrypted file saving and storing ever. These files can be encrypted with a game changing password system. Unlike most softwares that have length limits, no special characters, we here have no rules for that. You can make the most secure password ever, and you can only open it through our unarchiver. No other software can use torsec unarchivers, as they are made to not open when used on external unarchivers.

Heres how to use the website:

**Archiver:**

Archiver can be used to archive files you may need but dont want others accessing easily. All you need to do is click "select file", click your file from finder/files, enter a password and then press archive. It will auto download the file for you, in the .torsec format.

**Unarchiver**:

Unarchiver can be used to unarchive files. Just simply drag & drop or click select files, then use the .torsec file, enter the password given by the owner (if applicable) and press unarchive. This will auto download the file for you in the original format it used. 

**Contact:**

We have contact forums, in our discord and emails. Please email me at <sup>wolfdream226@gmail.com</sup> for bussiness related topics, and chat to me in discord @ discord.wolfymc.com . Please do not post spam/scam as we do not want that. Followc our rules and be safe!

**Q&A:**

1: Do you have rules for passwords/limits? No, we do not. You can make any password within your keyboards capabilities!

2: Can i unarchive the .torsec files anywhere else? Nope. You can only unarchive them here and nowhere else.

3: Is there a brew command for terminal/mac? No, not yet. We have still yet to integrate this software into commands you can use.

4: Where do i go to the website? Go to https://wolfdreamyt.github.io/TORSec.com and have fun!

5: Can i use this software for illegal activity? No, please use this for safe and good purposes only. And if your trying to sneak a message to another user in bigger servers ;)

6: Is there a premium software version? Nope! All of the code, website, file system, everything is coded and made for free! we do not need to have prremium versions since its lots of pain to setup. Instead, you can donate by going to my youtube channel (https://youtube.com/@wolfdream226) and subscribing! Thats the only payment i need!
